All servers must have Internet access in order to download software packages.
Operating System on them is CentOS7 with root user enabled.

1.Install and configure Docker for all nodes
2.Deploy a HA Kubernetes Cluster with kubeadm - Install kubeadm, kubectl and kubelet
3.Setting Up Kubernetes Cluster
4.Generating Master Configuration Files  - 
We generate one set of configuration files on Master01(192.168.100.10) and copy them onto all Master nodes.

5.Setting Up ETCD Cluster
Create the certificate folder
mkdir -p /etc/etcd/ssl
Create the etcd data director
mkdir -p /var/lib/etcd
scp -rp 192.168.100.10:/opt/ssl/*.pem /etc/etcd/ssl/
Create file /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service


6.Install Keepalived on All Master Nodes for HA Proxy
On Master01
Install keepalived
Create keepalived configu file /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf 
Start keepalived
systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable keepalived && systemctl restart keepalived
do the same stpes to all 3 master node.


7.kubeadm init --config kubeadm-config.yaml in All nodes
Initiating Master Cluster
On Master01
Create file kubeadm-config.yaml
kubeadm init --config kubeadm-config.yaml

Configure Kuberctl on All Master Nodes
 mkdir -p /root/.kube
# cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf /root/.kube/config
